## **🔍 Detailed Metric Explanations**

### **1. Institutional Flows (9% Weight)**

**What it measures:** Net flows from institutional investors (Grayscale, MicroStrategy, Bitcoin ETFs)
**Why it matters:** Institutional adoption is a key driver of long-term price appreciation
**Signals:**

- **Strong Inflows (>$50M):** Bullish - Smart money accumulating
- **Strong Outflows (<-$50M):** Bearish - Institutional selling
- **Neutral (-$10M to +$10M):** Hold - No clear institutional bias

### **2. DeFi TVL (8% Weight)**

**What it measures:** Total Value Locked across all DeFi protocols
**Why it matters:** Indicates DeFi ecosystem health and crypto utility beyond speculation
**Signals:**

- **Strong Growth (>5% weekly):** Bullish - DeFi adoption accelerating
- **Decline (<-5% weekly):** Bearish - DeFi ecosystem contracting
- **Stable (-2% to +2%):** Hold - Steady state

### **3. Stablecoin Flows (7% Weight)**

**What it measures:** Net USDT/USDC/BUSD flows to exchanges
**Why it matters:** Enhanced version of buying power analysis
**Signals:**

- **High Outflows (<-$1B):** Bullish - Stablecoins leaving exchanges (accumulation)
- **High Inflows (>$1B):** Bearish - Stablecoins entering exchanges (selling pressure)
- **Balanced (-$0.3B to +$0.3B):** Hold - Neutral flow

### **4. Liquidation Risk (6% Weight)**

**What it measures:** Clustering and pressure of liquidation levels
**Why it matters:** High liquidation risk can trigger cascading sell-offs
**Signals:**

- **Low Risk (<20):** Bullish - Opportunity for upward movement
- **High Risk (>80):** Bearish - Vulnerable to liquidation cascades
- **Normal (20-80):** Hold - Typical market conditions

### **5. Social Sentiment (6% Weight)**

**What it measures:** Aggregated sentiment from Twitter, Reddit, and news
**Why it matters:** Captures broader market psychology beyond just Google Trends
**Signals:**

- **Very Bullish (>0.3):** Bullish - Positive social momentum
- **Very Bearish (<-0.3):** Bearish - Negative social sentiment
- **Neutral (-0.1 to +0.1):** Hold - Balanced sentiment

### **6. BTC-Stock Correlation (5% Weight)**

**What it measures:** 30-day rolling correlation between BTC and S&P 500
**Why it matters:** High correlation means BTC acts like a risk asset, low correlation means diversification benefit
**Signals:**

- **Negative Correlation (<-0.1):** Bullish - BTC acting as hedge
- **High Correlation (>0.4):** Bearish - BTC vulnerable to stock market crashes
- **Low Correlation (-0.1 to +0.1):** Hold - Independent movement

### **7. Options Flow (5% Weight)**

**What it measures:** Put/Call ratio in crypto options markets
**Why it matters:** Shows sophisticated traders' positioning and market expectations
**Signals:**

- **Low Put/Call (<0.7):** Bullish - More calls than puts (bullish positioning)
- **High Put/Call (>1.3):** Bearish - More puts than calls (bearish positioning)
- **Neutral (0.7-1.3):** Hold - Balanced options positioning

### **8. Network Health (4% Weight)**

**Why it matters:** Strong network = secure and robust Bitcoin
**Signals:**

- **Excellent (>90):** Bullish - Network at peak strength
- **Poor (<60):** Bearish - Network vulnerabilities
- **Good (70-90):** Hold - Healthy network

### **9. Implied Volatility (4% Weight)**

**What it measures:** Options-implied volatility expectations
**Why it matters:** Low volatility often precedes major moves; extreme volatility can signal opportunities
**Signals:**

- **Extreme Volatility (>100%):** Bullish - High uncertainty creates opportunities
- **Low Volatility (<50%):** Bearish - Complacency, potential for surprise moves
- **Normal (50-100%):** Hold - Typical volatility levels

### **10. DeFi Yield Premium (3% Weight)**

**What it measures:** Yield spread between DeFi protocols and traditional finance
**Why it matters:** High spreads attract capital to crypto; compressed spreads suggest maturation
**Signals:**

- **High Premium (>8%):** Bullish - Attractive yields drawing capital
- **Low Premium (<2%):** Bearish - Limited yield advantage
- **Normal (3-8%):** Hold - Reasonable yield differential
